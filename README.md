# Description

If you are wont to memorize all zip code, or if you are a people who loves learning city, by its zip code,
or if you do not know at all where or what a zip code means, it is for you!

# Project Tree

Currently my tree, is so simple. Perhaps, it will change if I am not lazzy ðŸ˜‚

That's it! Here we go...

* [data/](.\data)
  * [zipcode.json](.\data\zipcode.json)
* [client.js](.\client.js)
* [package.json](.\package.json)
* [README.md](.\README.md)
* [run.cmd](.\run.cmd)
* [server.js](.\server.js)

# Installation and running

In truth, there is no installation at all ðŸ˜³. Yes!! I am serious.

I mean, if you are already `nodejs` developper, all things is already in your computer!

If that is not your case, here is what you need to do:
- Download and install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
- Then:
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/RFihobiana/Zip-Recognizer.git
    $ cd Zip-Recognizer
    ```
- Are you windows user? 

    - Yes? Type on your `powershell` or `cmd.exe`:
        ```ps
        .\run.cmd
        ```

    - You are on Linux? Open your favorite `terminal` and type this command bellow *one by one* there:
        ```console
        $ npm start &
        $ npm run client
        ```

**Congratulations!!!** You have it now!

# Note
Currently, this is for Madagascar only, and this do not use *GUI* for running. All things is in you console. *No need* to abuse your CPU ðŸ¤©
